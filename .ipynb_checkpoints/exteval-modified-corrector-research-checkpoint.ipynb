    "### EXTEVAL Metrics\n",
    "1. **Incorrect Coreference (INCORCOREFEVAL):**\n",

    "     - Specific mention(s)\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Incomplete Coreference (INCOMCOREFEVAL):**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Indicates missing or unclear antecedents for references in the text.\n",
    "   - **Details Provided:** Count and list of specific instances, including:\n",
    "     - Problematic sentence(s)\n",
    "     - Specific mention(s)\n",
    "     - Error type (e.g., \"missing antecedent\").\n",

    "   - **Details Provided:** Count and list of specific instances, including:\n",
    "     - Problematic sentence(s)\n",
    "     - Specific discourse marker(s).\n",

    "4. **Sentiment Bias (SENTIBIAS):**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Measures misalignment of sentiments between the source document and the summary.\n",
    "   - **Details Provided:**\n",
    "     - Absolute difference between document and summary sentiment.\n",
    "     - Average sentiment of the source document and summary.\n",
