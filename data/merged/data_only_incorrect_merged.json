        "document": "( cnn ) the lawyer for a baltimore community activist whose arrest was broadcast live on cnn said thursday morning that his client had been released from jail . as viewers watched , joseph kent held his hands up and walked in front of a phalanx of police tuesday night after a citywide curfew had started . seconds later , several officers in riot gear rushed out of their line and arrested him , just as a humvee passed between the camera and the police , making social media churn with questions about what happened to kent . attorney stephen patrick beatty confirmed he is representing kent . he was still trying to get in touch with his client after kent was released . `` he wanted me to tell people most that he does n't want violence in his name , '' beatty told cnn 's don lemon on wednesday night . the incident unfolded live on cnn about 40 minutes after the 10 p.m. curfew went into effect and as authorities tried to prevent the kind of rioting -- part of protests over the death of freddie gray -- that plagued the city monday . kent was being held on a charge of curfew violation , according to the maryland department of public safety and correctional services . people on twitter continued to circulate the name of kent , a young activist , making # josephkent and # whereisjosephkent hot topics . investigators made 10 arrests in baltimore on tuesday night , city police commissioner anthony batts said . seven were for curfew violations , he said . beatty said he met with kent on wednesday afternoon . `` he said he 's physically ok , not injured . he 's safe in there , '' beatty said . but even though more than 100 people who had been held at the city 's booking center were released earlier in the day , kent was not one of them . beatty initially checked on kent 's status , despite not officially representing him . he said kent was just trying to help with getting people to go home when he was arrested . `` he went out there to try to settle things down because he had seen what happened in this city previously , '' beatty said . `` and the last thing he wanted was any more violence , and he was trying to stop it . '' kent once was employed as an intern , through an outside company , at morgan state university 's entrepreneurial development and assistance center , the school said wednesday . but kent is not a student there and , as far as the school can tell , never has been , msu spokesman clint coleman said . a woman who answered the phone at the edac said that no one there was available to talk about kent and that she 'd have no further comment . in november , the baltimore city paper ran a story about kent , then 21 , and his participation in baltimore protests over a grand jury 's decision not to indict a police officer in the august shooting of teenager michael brown in ferguson , missouri . he helped lead protesters who walked through morgan state 's campus and eventually to city hall on november 25 , the newspaper reported . `` everyone knows me at morgan already , organizing and making sure everything ( is ) running the correct way and peaceful and everything like that , '' he said , according to the city paper 's article . `` so , everybody already knows i 'm going to do things the right way , so when everybody else and community people and civilians and people who joined and saw that the morgan students were looking up to it , before you knew it , the whole city was on my back and i was just carrying the whole city .

'' she did n't disclose the details of the settlement other than saying that `` one important aspect of it was an apology by kanye west to our client , daniel ramos . '' her statement included a picture of west and ramos shaking hands , which she said happened after the apology . the original incident was caught on video , including the following exchange . `` kanye ! kanye ! talk to me , kanye ! '' ramos shouts outside a terminal at the los angeles airport on the night of july 19 , 2013 . `` what 's ' going on ? why ca n't we talk to you ? i mean , why ? '' he asks as west moves through a group of paparazzi . `` now come on , kanye , i do n't want to fight with you , '' he says as west advances toward him . `` i told you , do n't talk to me , right , '' west says . `` you 're trying to get me in trouble so i step off and have to pay you like $ 250,000 . '' west is then seen rushing the photographer and attempting to wrestle his camera from his hands . west retreats after about 15 seconds of scuffling with the photographer . `` we believe that this case sent an important message , '' allred said . `` celebrities are not above the law , and they have no right to physically attack someone simply because they were asked a question . '' beverly hills police investigated an incident in january 2014 in which west was accused of assaulting a man at a beverly hills chiropractor 's office . west avoided criminal charges by reaching a civil settlement with the man . kanye west apologizes to beck , bruno mars . cnn 's sonya hamasaki contributed to this report .",

'' the detention of wei tingting , along with wu rongrong , li tingting , wang man and zheng churan has drawn harsh criticism from the international community . protesters in several cities have called for their release and taken to social media with the phrase `` free the five '' as a hashtag . wang qiushi , the lawyer for wei , said police recommended monday that prosecutors press charges of `` assembling a crowd to disturb public order . '' prosecutors have seven days -- until monday -- to decide whether to pursue the charges , according to the lawyer . `` we can do nothing but wait , '' wang said . the five were initially held on suspicion of `` picking quarrels and provoking trouble . '' wang said he did n't know why the charge against the women changed . `` neither should constitute a crime , '' he said . campaign group amnesty international said the new charge was less serious but still carried a maximum prison term of five years . `` the women were doing nothing wrong , nothing illegal . they were simply calling for an end to sexual harassment , '' said william nee , china researcher at amnesty international . wang said that wei was subjected to lengthy cross examinations during her detention . two of the women are said to be in poor health . he added that the charges relate both to the activities the women planned for international women 's day and earlier campaigns against domestic violence . the five are members of china 's women 's rights action group . they had planned to hand out stickers with slogans saying `` stop sexual harassment , let us stay safe '' and `` go police , go arrest those who committed sexual harassment ! '' on international women 's day . this week , kerry 's predecessor , hillary clinton , tweeted that the activists ' detention was `` inexcusable .

'' prosecutors have seven days -- until monday -- to decide whether to pursue the charges , according to the lawyer . `` we can do nothing but wait , '' wang said . the five were initially held on suspicion of `` picking quarrels and provoking trouble . '' wang said he did n't know why the charge against the women changed . `` neither should constitute a crime , '' he said . campaign group amnesty international said the new charge was less serious but still carried a maximum prison term of five years . `` the women were doing nothing wrong , nothing illegal . they were simply calling for an end to sexual harassment , '' said william nee , china researcher at amnesty international . wang said that wei was subjected to lengthy cross examinations during her detention . two of the women are said to be in poor health . he added that the charges relate both to the activities the women planned for international women 's day and earlier campaigns against domestic violence . the five are members of china 's women 's rights action group . they had planned to hand out stickers with slogans saying `` stop sexual harassment , let us stay safe '' and `` go police , go arrest those who committed sexual harassment ! '' on international women 's day . this week , kerry 's predecessor , hillary clinton , tweeted that the activists ' detention was `` inexcusable . '' chinese authorities rebuked her comment , saying public figures should respect the nation 's sovereignty and independence . cnn 's katie hunt and shen lu contributed to this report .",

'' the foreign office also blamed what it said was india 's delay in cooperating in the case , saying it `` weakened the prosecution . '' in the mumbai attacks , heavily armed men stormed landmark buildings around mumbai , including luxury hotels , the city 's historic victoria terminus train station and a jewish cultural center . india executed the last surviving gunman from the attacks in 2012 . other suspects were all killed during the series of attacks , which went on for three days . more about the mumbai attacks . cnn 's harmeet singh contributed to this report .",

        "document": "( cnn ) the last time muhammadu buhari came to power in nigeria , it was by force . this time it was by the ballot box . here are five reasons why one of the most fiercely-contested elections in the country 's history is so important . for the first time in nigeria 's history , the opposition defeated the ruling party in democratic elections . muhammadu buhari , 72 , won nigeria 's presidential election , defeating incumbent goodluck jonathan by about two million votes . nigeria is significant because it is the biggest economy and most populous country in africa ; it is also one of africa 's largest oil producers and is a major supplier of crude oil to the united states . this is n't buhari 's first time leading nigeria -- but it 's his first time in nearly 30 years . the reformed dictator is a sunni muslim from nigeria 's poorer north , while jonathan comes from a christian and animist south that is rich with oil . buhari 's win comes after a long history of military rule , coups and botched attempts at democracy in the country . many nigerians told cnn that they saw president jonathan as an ineffectual leader who was indecisive in dealing with the terror group boko haram -- and weak on corruption . buhari , who was campaigning for the fourth time , capitalized on these weaknesses and some analysts believe that his military background was an advantage for him . nigerians wanted a strong leader who could keep them safe from boko haram 's murderous raids -- and buhari also campaigned as a born-again democrat to allay fears about his strict military regime the last time around . he stressed that nigeria 's security needs to be the next government 's focus . his campaign was also fiercely anti-corruption -- he ran under the slogan of `` new broom , '' and his supporters were often pictured holding brooms in the lead-up to the vote . the elections were largely predicted to be violent and everyone , nigerians included , expected the worst . some families moved abroad and there was sporadic violence across the country in the lead up to the election . but those fears turned out to be mostly unfounded , and the elections held relatively peacefully -- with the exception of attacks in the north of the country , where around 11 people died . many also praised president jonathan 's gracious and quick concession of defeat as it almost certainly prevented post-election violence . president-elect buhari said wednesday in a speech to the nation : `` the eyes of the world were focused on us to see if we can vote in a peaceful way and carry out elections in an orderly manner . `` we have proven to the world that we are a people who have embraced democracy and a people who seek a government by , for and for the people . '' on election day , nigerians queued for hours in hot weather to cast their vote . some of the biometric reader machines malfunctioned -- including the one at president jonathan 's polling station -- and voting had to be extended into the following day . but the technical issues did n't keep people from voting -- and in lagos , some voters cast their ballots with the aid of the light from their mobile phones . and even though some card readers did n't work in some places , many say they helped to cut down on vote rigging . boko haram is n't the only obstacle facing the new president . the economy , crime and generating enough power to light up the country are other major issues . the pressure will soon be on buhari to deliver and there will be no excuses . if he fails , nigerians will be waiting for him at the polls just four short years from now .",

        "document": "( cnn ) film critic richard corliss , whose populist passion for all genres of movies illuminated time magazine 's coverage of cinema for 35 years , died thursday night in new york city . he was 71 . corliss died a week after suffering a major stroke , according to a tribute on time 's website by colleague richard zoglin , who called him `` perhaps the magazine 's most quoted writer of all time . '' unlike some critics , corliss appreciated all kinds of movies -- from the arty drama of ingmar bergman to the epic fantasy of `` the lord of the rings . '' his all-time top 100 movies list , which he compiled with fellow time critic richard schickel , contained everything from `` pulp fiction '' to `` finding nemo '' to jackie chan 's `` drunken master ii . '' `` he savored it all : the good , the bad , the indifferent . except that he was indifferent to nothing , '' zoglin wrote . `` to any fan or friend who would ask whether a new movie was ' worth seeing , ' corliss had a stock , succinct reply : ' everything is worth seeing . ' `` but corliss was not afraid to puncture hype around big movies he found overrated , including `` titanic '' ( `` dead in the water '' ) and even -- blasphemy ! -- `` star wars , '' about which he wrote , `` the movie 's ' legs ' will prove as vulnerable as c-3po 's . '' he also did n't care much for sentimental , uplifting movies that often become mainstream hits and win oscars . `` there are movies whose feel-good sentiments and slick craft annoy me so deeply that i know they will become box-office successes or top prizewinners , '' he once wrote . `` i call this internal mechanism my built-in hit detector . '' a graceful and prolific writer , corliss reviewed more than 1,000 movies , penned many time cover stories and authored four books on film , including `` mom in the movies : the iconic screen mothers you love ( and a few you love to hate ) , '' published just last year . ( it was a partnership with turner classic movies , which , like cnn , is owned by turner broadcasting . ) some credit him with coining the phrase `` drop-dead gorgeous '' to describe actress michelle pfeiffer in a review of her 1985 film , `` into the night . '' he also cleverly , and subtly , gave away the big plot spoiler of `` the crying game '' by spelling it out with the first letters of each paragraph of his review . born in philadelphia , corliss moved to new york after college and began writing film reviews for a variety of publications before joining time in 1980 . he served as editor of film comment , the movie journal of the film society of lincoln center , for 20 years , was a frequent guest on charlie rose 's talk show and made annual pilgrimages to film festivals in cannes , toronto and venice . `` it 's painful to try to find words , since richard was such a master of them , '' time editor nancy gibbs wrote in a note friday to her staffers . `` they were his tools , his toys , to the point that it felt sometimes as though he had to write , like the rest of us breathe and eat and sleep . it 's not clear that richard ever slept , for the sheer expanse of his knowledge and writing defies the normal contours of professional life .

'' clinton was considered inevitable to win the nomination in 2008 but ended up losing to barack obama . o'malley had previously dropped the inevitability comment in a television interview last month . the former governor , who capped off his two-day trip to the first-in-the-nation caucus state with a speech to the polk county democrats in des moines , said that although clinton is an `` eminently qualified candidate , '' the democratic party is full of `` good leaders . '' `` history is full of examples where people who are not very well known nationally can be very well known once they are willing to make their case to the people of iowa , '' o'malley said . in some polls , he has scored in the low single digits in the state . in a march cnn/orc poll of national democrats , only 1 % picked o'malley . in a january poll by bloomberg politics and the des moines register , o'malley was also at 1 % among iowa democrats . clinton , who leads most polls by upwards of 40 points , is planning to launch her presidential candidacy on sunday through a video message on social media , a person close to her campaign-in-waiting told cnn on friday . while he would n't say much about clinton , when asked about her candidacy , o'malley said , `` if leaders believe that they have the experience and the framework to move our country forward , they should run . and they should engage with voters and our country would be the better for it . '' o'malley , like other democrats , appears to refrain from directly attacking clinton . although last month on abc , he said that the presidency is `` not some crown to be passed between two families , '' he has not focused on her . he has , however , openly teased a presidential run . `` i know that , as democrats , we expect -- and i have heard this all over the country -- the democrats expect a robust conversation about the issues we face as a nation and the challenges we face , '' he said . `` they believe that that conversation needs to take place in something as important as a presidential primary . '' he concluded : `` it would be an extreme poverty indeed if there was only one person willing to compete for our party 's nomination for president . ''",
