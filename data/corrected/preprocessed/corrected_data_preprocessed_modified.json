term , the health of <span style='color:#FF00FF'> [6]  these crabs </span> could still be precarious . <br>13.  <u> i have been working with colleagues at florida international university and university of louisiana at lafayette to better understand what might be happening biologically inside <span style='color:#FFC0CB'> [7]  the crab </span> when <span style='color:#FFC0CB'> [7]  it </span> is exposed to oil and the dispersant used to respond to <span style='color:#FF0000'> [0]  the spill </span> . </u> <br>14.  using the power of genomics and computational biology , <span style='color:#A52A2A'> [9]  we </span> analyzed the genes of flat back mud crabs that were exposed to oil from the macondo prospect where <span style='color:#FFA500'> [8]  the deepwater horizon rig </span> was drilling when <span style='color:#FFA500'> [8]  it </span> exploded or to a combination of oil and dispersant in the lab . <br>15.  by studying gene expression , the process that turns information from a gene into a product that functions within a cell , <span style='color:#A52A2A'> [9]  we </span> searched for indicators that might signal exposure to oil and , based on the types of changes we might see , clues as to how <span style='color:#FF00FF'> [6]  the crabs </span> respond . <br>16.  although <span style='color:#A52A2A'> [9]  we </span> are still in the early stages of <span style='color:#A52A2A'> [9]  our </span> research , <span style='color:#A52A2A'> [9]  we </span> are seeing significant differences in gene expression connected to exposure -- meaning <span style='color:#FF00FF'> [6]  the crabs </span> are <span style='color:#800000'> [10]  turning </span> some genes on or off in response to oil and dispersant . <br>17.  <span style='color:#A52A2A'> [9]  we </span> are still working to determine whether <span style='color:#800000'> [10]  these changes </span> impact <span style='color:#FF00FF'> [6]  their </span> ability to survive and reproduce . <br>18.  it 's not just gulf crabs that are experiencing changes . <br>19.  research on different species and other aspects of the regional environment is starting to show that there could be <span style='color:#008000'> [11]  long - term effects resulting from the oil spill and the response to the spill </span> . <br>20.  <span style='color:#008000'> [11]  this </span> not only has consequences for the gulf area , where oil drilling continues , but also for communities along the atlantic coast , where the obama administration has recently announced a plan to open unprecedented oil and natural gas exploration . <br>21.  ( bp 's vice president of communications , geoff morrell , told <span style='color:#808000'> [12]  cnn </span> that wildlife species in <span style='color:#0000FF'> [2]  the gulf </span> have ` ` bounced back and ` ` there is no data that suggests there are any long - term population - level impacts to any species . '' <br>22.  ) with the virtual certainty of more spills , we need a lot more information on the consequences of <span style='color:#7FFD4'> [13]  these disasters </span> and how we can combat <span style='color:#7FFD4'> [13]  them </span> effectively and efficiently . <br>23.  <span style='color:#00008B'> [14]  the u.s . <br>24.  department of the interior and the environmental protection agency </span> are making some progress . <br>25.  in coming months , <span style='color:#00008B'> [14]  they </span> are releasing changes to regulations and response plans based on the early lessons learned from <span style='color:#FF0000'> [0]  the deepwater horizon spill </span> . <br>26.  but government agencies can not just rely on the short - term data to determine the best response for the next oil spill crisis . <br>27.  <u> instead , the government and oil companies should work together to support ongoing , long - term ecological research so that we have a better grasp of what <span style='color:#ADD8E6'> [15]  ` ` normal '' </span> looks like and what factors are important in maintaining <span style='color:#ADD8E6'> [15]  those conditions </span> even after a disastrous oil spill . </u> <br>28.  only then will we truly understand the impact of offshore drilling and the best ways to respond to crises to protect our most important natural resources ."

'' clinton was considered inevitable to win the nomination in 2008 but ended up losing to barack obama . o'malley had previously dropped the inevitability comment in a television interview last month . the former governor , who capped off his two-day trip to the first-in-the-nation caucus state with a speech to the polk county democrats in des moines , said that although clinton is an `` eminently qualified candidate , '' the democratic party is full of `` good leaders . '' `` history is full of examples where people who are not very well known nationally can be very well known once they are willing to make their case to the people of iowa , '' o'malley said . in some polls , he has scored in the low single digits in the state . in a march cnn/orc poll of national democrats , only 1 % picked o'malley . in a january poll by bloomberg politics and the des moines register , o'malley was also at 1 % among iowa democrats . clinton , who leads most polls by upwards of 40 points , is planning to launch her presidential candidacy on sunday through a video message on social media , a person close to her campaign-in-waiting told cnn on friday . while he would n't say much about clinton , when asked about her candidacy , o'malley said , `` if leaders believe that they have the experience and the framework to move our country forward , they should run . and they should engage with voters and our country would be the better for it . '' o'malley , like other democrats , appears to refrain from directly attacking clinton . although last month on abc , he said that the presidency is `` not some crown to be passed between two families , '' he has not focused on her . he has , however , openly teased a presidential run . `` i know that , as democrats , we expect -- and i have heard this all over the country -- the democrats expect a robust conversation about the issues we face as a nation and the challenges we face , '' he said . `` they believe that that conversation needs to take place in something as important as a presidential primary . '' he concluded : `` it would be an extreme poverty indeed if there was only one person willing to compete for our party 's nomination for president . ''",
