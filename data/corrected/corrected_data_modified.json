( bp 's vice president of communications , geoff morrell , told cnn that wildlife species in the gulf have `` bounced back and `` there is no data that suggests there are any long-term population-level impacts to any species . '' ) with the virtual certainty of more spills , we need a lot more information on the consequences of these disasters and how we can combat them effectively and efficiently . the u.s. department of the interior and the environmental protection agency are making some progress . in coming months , they are releasing changes to regulations and response plans based on the early lessons learned from the deepwater horizon spill . but government agencies can not just rely on the short-term data to determine the best response for the next oil spill crisis . instead , the government and oil companies should work together to support ongoing , long-term ecological research so that we have a better grasp of what `` normal '' looks like and what factors are important in maintaining those conditions even after a disastrous oil spill . only then will we truly understand the impact of offshore drilling and the best ways to respond to crises to protect our most important natural resources .",

        "document": "( cnn ) five years after the deepwater horizon rig exploded and unleashed the largest marine oil spill in the nation 's history , we are still experiencing -- yet only beginning to truly understand -- its profound environmental and economic repercussions . the immediate aftermath of the oil spill has been well documented , with declines in tourism and the seafood industry , as well as the significant destruction of wildlife in the region . since then , the amount of oil in the area has dissipated and communities have started to show signs of recovery . in fact , reports indicate that the gulf of mexico 's seafood industry , which supplies the united states with roughly 40 % of its seafood , is finally starting to rebound . however , profound challenges remain , in part because so many questions about the long-term consequences remain unanswered . to this day , it 's still unclear where all of the oil went , exactly how much remains or whether the reappearance of wildlife is a result of adaptation or a signal that the crisis is truly abating . one of the populations that can provide insight into these questions is the gulf crab . crabs play an important role in the region : roughly 60 million pounds were fished in the gulf in 2012 , earning tens of millions in revenue . yet in the aftermath of the spill , changes to crustacean communities in the area were quite apparent to the naked eye . researchers documented substantial differences in appearance , and deformities in crabs that were affected by the spill including lesions so numerous they ate through the joints , forcing limbs to fall off . these traits have affected not only the crabs ' market value but also likely their ability to survive . while these changes in outward appearance have dissipated in the short-term , the health of these crabs could still be precarious . i have been working with colleagues at florida international university and university of louisiana at lafayette to better understand what might be happening biologically inside the crab when it is exposed to oil and the dispersant used to respond to the spill . using the power of genomics and computational biology , we analyzed the genes of flat back mud crabs that were exposed to oil from the macondo prospect where the deepwater horizon rig was drilling when it exploded or to a combination of oil and dispersant in the lab . by studying gene expression , the process that turns information from a gene into a product that functions within a cell , we searched for indicators that might signal exposure to oil and , based on the types of changes we might see , clues as to how the crabs respond . although we are still in the early stages of our research , we are seeing significant differences in gene expression connected to exposure -- meaning the crabs are turning some genes on or off in response to oil and dispersant . we are still working to determine whether these changes impact their ability to survive and reproduce . it 's not just gulf crabs that are experiencing changes . research on different species and other aspects of the regional environment is starting to show that there could be long-term effects resulting from the oil spill and the response to the spill . this not only has consequences for the gulf area , where oil drilling continues , but also for communities along the atlantic coast , where the obama administration has recently announced a plan to open unprecedented oil and natural gas exploration . ( bp 's vice president of communications , geoff morrell , told cnn that wildlife species in the gulf have `` bounced back and `` there is no data that suggests there are any long-term population-level impacts to any species . '' ) with the virtual certainty of more spills , we need a lot more information on the consequences of these disasters and how we can combat them effectively and efficiently . the u.s. department of the interior and the environmental protection agency are making some progress . in coming months , they are releasing changes to regulations and response plans based on the early lessons learned from the deepwater horizon spill . but government agencies can not just rely on the short-term data to determine the best response for the next oil spill crisis . instead , the government and oil companies should work together to support ongoing , long-term ecological research so that we have a better grasp of what `` normal '' looks like and what factors are important in maintaining those conditions even after a disastrous oil spill . only then will we truly understand the impact of offshore drilling and the best ways to respond to crises to protect our most important natural resources .",

'' even though he looked calm , defense lawyer tamara brady started her question and answer session with jurors tuesday by expression concerns about holmes getting a fair and impartial trial , saying `` i 'm nervous '' and `` my client is nervous . '' district attorney george brauchler warned jurors to brace themselves . tuesday 's court session , he said , was the lawyers ' last chance to find out if there is `` any reason you should n't be one of the 24 to sit through the four to five months of a horrible roller coaster through the worst haunted house you can imagine .

'' she is dedicated to making sure theia gets the medical attention she needs , mellado adds , and wants to `` make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again !

'' `` he savored it all : the good , the bad , the indifferent . except that he was indifferent to nothing , '' zoglin wrote . `` to any fan or friend who would ask whether a new movie was ' worth seeing , ' corliss had a stock , succinct reply : ' everything is worth seeing . ' `` but corliss was not afraid to puncture hype around big movies he found overrated , including `` titanic '' ( `` dead in the water '' ) and even -- blasphemy ! -- `` star wars , '' about which he wrote , `` the movie 's ' legs ' will prove as vulnerable as c-3po 's . '' he also did n't care much for sentimental , uplifting movies that often become mainstream hits and win oscars . `` there are movies whose feel-good sentiments and slick craft annoy me so deeply that i know they will become box-office successes or top prizewinners , '' he once wrote . `` i call this internal mechanism my built-in hit detector . '' a graceful and prolific writer , corliss reviewed more than 1,000 movies , penned many time cover stories and authored four books on film , including `` mom in the movies : the iconic screen mothers you love ( and a few you love to hate ) , '' published just last year . ( it was a partnership with turner classic movies , which , like cnn , is owned by turner broadcasting . ) some credit him with coining the phrase `` drop-dead gorgeous '' to describe actress michelle pfeiffer in a review of her 1985 film , `` into the night . '' he also cleverly , and subtly , gave away the big plot spoiler of `` the crying game '' by spelling it out with the first letters of each paragraph of his review . born in philadelphia , corliss moved to new york after college and began writing film reviews for a variety of publications before joining time in 1980 . he served as editor of film comment , the movie journal of the film society of lincoln center , for 20 years , was a frequent guest on charlie rose 's talk show and made annual pilgrimages to film festivals in cannes , toronto and venice . `` it 's painful to try to find words , since richard was such a master of them , '' time editor nancy gibbs wrote in a note friday to her staffers . `` they were his tools , his toys , to the point that it felt sometimes as though he had to write , like the rest of us breathe and eat and sleep . it 's not clear that richard ever slept , for the sheer expanse of his knowledge and writing defies the normal contours of professional life . '' he is survived by his wife , mary , a noted film critic in her own right , whom he married in 1969 . people we 've lost in 2015 .",

' '' said clooney , referring to one of her most legendary lines from her first movie . the 750-piece collection , which fetched a total of $ 3.64 million , featured bronze sculptures , jewelry , and a number of decorative arts and paintings , which were sold at bonhams auction house in new york . `` her collection is truly a reflection of her extraordinary taste and remarkable life , '' said jon king , bonhams ' vice president . among the 50 items highlighted in the auction preview were six bronze maquettes by henry moore , britain 's greatest 20th century sculptor and one of bacall 's favorite artists , whom she developed a close relationship with . one of them sold for close to $ 120,000 . also for sale were some of bacall 's most loved jewelry pieces , created by legendary french designer jean schlumberger , most known for his work at tiffany & co . a rose diamond camel brooch by british jeweler elizabeth gage fetched $ 23,750 and was accompanied by the original drawing and correspondence from the designer , which shows the close-knit relationship bacall had with gage . the wide-ranging collection was expected to appeal to a variety of collectors : fine arts and antiques dealers , fans of lauren bacall and humphrey bogart , as well as memorabilia enthusiasts . most of the items auctioned come from the apartment in new york 's dakota building that she shared with her second husband , actor jason robards , until 1969 . but king said fans of humphrey bogart would have been pleased to know some of the items were also from their shared residence in los angeles . king , who got to know bacall in her late years , said the collection reflects the actress ' eclectic taste , and there was only one principle she applied to collecting : `` everything had to kind of speak to her , to catch her eye . she loved form , she loved texture , she loved color . and she loved mixing it all up . she said that when you walked into her house , what she liked was that it was never boring , '' king said . `` you could walk into the same room a hundred times , and see something new every time .

'' iran had been in the running to host the 2019 edition of soccer 's asian cup , but the tournament was awarded to the united arab emirates . the ban on women attending matches was widely seen as a major impediment to iran 's chances of securing the event . the ban came under the spotlight at the asian cup in australia earlier this year , when thousands of female iranian fans watched their soccer team without restriction . during the match against iraq , activists called for the ban to end and unfurled a banner showing the face of ghoncheh ghavami , a british-iranian woman detained in iran last year while trying to watch a volleyball match . iranian officials have denied that ghavami was arrested for attending the volleyball game , saying she was taken into custody for `` anti-iran activities . '' the news agency reuters reported that she was recently pardoned by the court of appeal . cnn 's annie ramos contributed to this report .",

        "document": "( cnn ) five years after the deepwater horizon rig exploded and unleashed the largest marine oil spill in the nation 's history , we are still experiencing -- yet only beginning to truly understand -- its profound environmental and economic repercussions . the immediate aftermath of the oil spill has been well documented , with declines in tourism and the seafood industry , as well as the significant destruction of wildlife in the region . since then , the amount of oil in the area has dissipated and communities have started to show signs of recovery . in fact , reports indicate that the gulf of mexico 's seafood industry , which supplies the united states with roughly 40 % of its seafood , is finally starting to rebound . however , profound challenges remain , in part because so many questions about the long-term consequences remain unanswered . to this day , it 's still unclear where all of the oil went , exactly how much remains or whether the reappearance of wildlife is a result of adaptation or a signal that the crisis is truly abating . one of the populations that can provide insight into these questions is the gulf crab . crabs play an important role in the region : roughly 60 million pounds were fished in the gulf in 2012 , earning tens of millions in revenue . yet in the aftermath of the spill , changes to crustacean communities in the area were quite apparent to the naked eye . researchers documented substantial differences in appearance , and deformities in crabs that were affected by the spill including lesions so numerous they ate through the joints , forcing limbs to fall off . these traits have affected not only the crabs ' market value but also likely their ability to survive . while these changes in outward appearance have dissipated in the short-term , the health of these crabs could still be precarious . i have been working with colleagues at florida international university and university of louisiana at lafayette to better understand what might be happening biologically inside the crab when it is exposed to oil and the dispersant used to respond to the spill . using the power of genomics and computational biology , we analyzed the genes of flat back mud crabs that were exposed to oil from the macondo prospect where the deepwater horizon rig was drilling when it exploded or to a combination of oil and dispersant in the lab . by studying gene expression , the process that turns information from a gene into a product that functions within a cell , we searched for indicators that might signal exposure to oil and , based on the types of changes we might see , clues as to how the crabs respond . although we are still in the early stages of our research , we are seeing significant differences in gene expression connected to exposure -- meaning the crabs are turning some genes on or off in response to oil and dispersant . we are still working to determine whether these changes impact their ability to survive and reproduce . it 's not just gulf crabs that are experiencing changes . research on different species and other aspects of the regional environment is starting to show that there could be long-term effects resulting from the oil spill and the response to the spill . this not only has consequences for the gulf area , where oil drilling continues , but also for communities along the atlantic coast , where the obama administration has recently announced a plan to open unprecedented oil and natural gas exploration . ( bp 's vice president of communications , geoff morrell , told cnn that wildlife species in the gulf have `` bounced back and `` there is no data that suggests there are any long-term population-level impacts to any species . '' ) with the virtual certainty of more spills , we need a lot more information on the consequences of these disasters and how we can combat them effectively and efficiently . the u.s. department of the interior and the environmental protection agency are making some progress . in coming months , they are releasing changes to regulations and response plans based on the early lessons learned from the deepwater horizon spill . but government agencies can not just rely on the short-term data to determine the best response for the next oil spill crisis . instead , the government and oil companies should work together to support ongoing , long-term ecological research so that we have a better grasp of what `` normal '' looks like and what factors are important in maintaining those conditions even after a disastrous oil spill . only then will we truly understand the impact of offshore drilling and the best ways to respond to crises to protect our most important natural resources .",
